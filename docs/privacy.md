# Privacy Policy — Creator’s Orderbook

**Effective date:** 2026-01-11

Creator’s Orderbook (“the App”) is designed to help creators and handmade businesses track orders, deadlines, and payments.

This Privacy Policy explains what data the App collects (if any), how it is used, and your choices.

## Summary
- **No account required.**
- **Your data stays on your device.**
- The App **does not sell** personal data.
- The App **does not use** third-party analytics or advertising SDKs (unless you add them later).

## Data the App processes
The App lets you enter information such as:
- Order title and notes
- Client name (optional)
- Deadlines and order status
- Payment amounts (total, advance paid)
- Currency

This information is stored **locally on your device** to provide the core functionality of the App.

## Data collection
Creator’s Orderbook **does not collect, transmit, or store your personal data on external servers**.

## Third-party services
The App currently **does not integrate** third-party services for analytics, advertising, or tracking.

(If this changes in a future version, this policy will be updated.)

## Permissions
The App does not require special permissions to function.  
If a future feature requires a permission (for example, photo access for attachments), the App will request it explicitly and only when needed.

## Data retention & deletion
Because data is stored on your device:
- You can delete an order inside the App.
- You can delete all App data by uninstalling the App from your device.

## Children’s privacy
The App is not intended for children under 13. The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to this policy
If the App’s privacy practices change, this Privacy Policy may be updated.  
The “Effective date” at the top will reflect the latest version.
