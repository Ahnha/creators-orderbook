## Common questions

### Where is my data stored?
Creator’s Orderbook stores your orders **locally on your device**. The app does not require an account.

### Can I export my data?
Yes — you can export your orders (e.g., CSV/Excel export) from the app.

### I changed my phone. Can I transfer data?
If you restore your iPhone from an iCloud backup, local app data may be restored as part of that backup. (Availability depends on your iOS backup settings.)
